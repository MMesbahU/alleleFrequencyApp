##Useful information

^1^Genetic and allelic heterogeneity:
For a dominant disorder the allelic heterogeneity is the maximum proportion of disease that can be attributed to a single variant and the genetic heterogeneity is 1. In the recessive (biallelic) case, the genetic heterogeneity represents the maximum proportion of disease attributable to a single gene and the allelic heterogeneity is then the maximum proportion of disease due to that gene that can be attributed to a single variant.

^2^Confidence:
Increasing the confidence widens the Poisson distribution so increases the acceptable reference AC.

^3^Reference population size:
We recommend using the number of individuals successfully sequenced at the site rather than the full population size to calculate an accurate maximum AC. The stringency of the approach depends the reference population size. The smaller the reference population size, the wider the confidence intervals of the Poisson distribution are.
