##ABOUT THE TOOLS  
This frequency filter application allows users to explore the architecture of a genetic disease and hence calculate whether an observed allele count in a reference population is compatible with disease causation. The full approach is detailed in …

We provide multiple tools to aid different interpretation steps that can be found in the tabs across the top of the page. Brief explanations of these are:  

1.	calculate AF – this tool allows you to follow the full approach through by first defining a “maximum credible population allele frequency” for a disorder and then defining the “maximum reference allele count” in a reference population of a defined size
2.	calculate AC – this tool allows the user to enter a pre-defined “maximum credible population allele frequency” and use it to calculate the “maximum reference allele count” in a reference population of a defined size
3.	explore architecture – this tool enables the user to explore the architecture of a disease by selecting the desired output (prevalence, heterogeneity, penetrance or max allele frequency) and varying the values of the remaining criteria
4.	inverse AF – this tool allows a user to calculate the maximum population allele frequency compatible with the observe allele count of a variant in a reference population of a defined size
