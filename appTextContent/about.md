This web app providess a suite of tools to support the use of allele frequency information for the assessment of rare genetic variants in Mendelian disease.

The methods and mathematical derivations behind the calculators on these pages are described fully in our manuscript available [here](insertLink).  The source code for the manuscript, along with all data and code necessary to reproduce the analyses, is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ImperialCardioGenetics/frequencyFilter).

These pages were built using [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com), and the source code is freely available [here](https://github.com/jamesware/alleleFrequencyApp).

The app was designed and implemented by James Ware, and is maintained by members of the [Ware lab](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/j.ware) at Imperial College London.
